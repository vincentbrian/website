<h4>Final Project</h4>

<p>The final project for this illustration class was to create a children's book.
  The book had to be illustrated in any style you wanted and the story content had
  to be well thought out and revised. Also, there had to be a minimum of three
  complete spreads.  The rest of the pages had to be fully drawn out
  but not colored. The timeline for this project was two weeks.</p>

<h2>Influences</h2>
<h2>Leonardo Da Vinci</h2>
<h4>Born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, Italy, Leonardo da Vinci was the epitome of a “Renaissance man.” Possessor of a curious mind and keen intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which greatly informed his work as a painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, military engineer and draftsman. His ideas and body of work—which includes "Virgin of the Rocks," "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa"—have influenced countless artists and made da Vinci a leading light of the Italian Renaissance.

<h2>Howie Green</h2>
<h4>Boston-based since the early 1970s Howie was raised in East Rochester and Clarence Center, NY. Howie Green has a unique artist's eye for the colorful fun that springs out of our popular culture. Images from comics, celebities, movies, TV and various other flotsam and jetsam that washes up on the rocky shores of our popular media all make their way into Howie's colorful and fun Pop Art creations.
Howie uses a pop-fauvist color pallette and has an eclectic, upbeat, approach to his subject matter. Howie says a lot of people tell him that they love "his colors". Howie comments "My colors? They don't belong to me. Colors are out there floating around. I just happen to use them all!"

<h2>Mel Marcelo</h2>
<h4>He was born in the Philippines, but raised on a steady diet of American culture. As a self-described “Navy brat,” he moved to the States when he was six, living in Washington, Hawaii and San Diego, back to the Philippines and eventually fortunate enough to end up back in San Diego. He attended college at the University of California, San Diego, earning a BA in Visual Arts with minor in Japanese Studies.
Mel divides his professional life between his fine art and being a “pencil for hire”, creating stunning editorial and advertising images for Newsweek, Oakley and a host of other clients in the music and apparel industries. Culture, music, fashion and sports are big components in his life, and it shows, both in his energetic style and the clients in his portfolio.
