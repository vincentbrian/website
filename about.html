      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>I am a detail oriented and passionate front end developer and digital artist. I began learning HTML, CSS and Javacript about 2 years ago while I was getting my degree at Endicott College in Beverly, MA. I was working at an ecommerce start up and immediately became intrigued by the fast paced and energetic enviornment. Since then, I've worked alongside a senior software developer/ mentor (and now friend) to build my knowledge and understanding of computer science and engineering. In addition to learning font end basics, I expanded my knowledge to implement Bootstrap, JQuery and GitHub while maintaining clean and industry-standard code.
      </p>
      <p>I'm passionate about creating aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly websites. My favorite part of building websites and creating digital experiences is learning and seeing projects come to life from ideation to completion. I have experience in digital art with an eye for design and attention to detail.
      </p>

      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      <p>I start my work with a mental mathematical judgment of the human figure: starting with the bone, muscle and then skin. All of my work is related to the human form in one way or another. After I sketch out the basic anatomy of my figure and the position I then begin to make my artwork.
      </p>
      <p>I admire Leonardo Da Vinci’s work and his genius. The life studies of the anatomy of the human figure are mesmerizing in the way he captured what he saw in front of him. His thought process of the surrounding world and how he was so far ahead of his time with his inventions. The way the depicted his inventions and the purpose for them is what I stride for.
      </p>
      <p>The energy that Howie Green puts into his work through the saturation of colors give me an instant reaction of liveliness. The color variation in his brush strokes are brilliant. He has grasped the color concept and the variations between their shades, tones, saturation and hue.
      </p>
      <p>In my work one can expect to see crazy strokes of colors that create shading and prominent line work. Due to my ADHD my color and shading is very random and crazy but my OCD allows my line work to be very clear and prominent. With the result of my artwork I try to captivate my audience whether it be through the color, the focus, or the overall aesthetic. I feed off energy as a person and I want to share that feeling.
