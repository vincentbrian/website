    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
    <p>I start my work with a mental mathematical judgment of the human figure: starting with the bone, muscle and then skin. All of my work is related to the human form in one way or another. After I sketch out the basic anatomy of my figure and the position I then begin to make my artwork.
    </p>
    <p>I admire Leonardo Da Vinciâ€™s work and his genius. The life studies of the anatomy of the human figure are mesmerizing in the way he captured what he saw in front of him. His thought process of the surrounding world and how he was so far ahead of his time with his inventions. The way the depicted his inventions and the purpose for them is what I stride for.
    </p>
    <p>The energy that Howie Green puts into his work through the saturation of colors give me an instant reaction of liveliness. The color variation in his brush strokes are brilliant. He has grasped the color concept and the variations between their shades, tones, saturation and hue.
    </p>
    <p>In my work one can expect to see crazy strokes of colors that create shading and prominent line work. Due to my ADHD my color and shading is very random and crazy but my OCD allows my line work to be very clear and prominent. With the result of my artwork I try to captivate my audience whether it be through the color, the focus, or the overall aesthetic. I feed off energy as a person and I want to share that feeling.
